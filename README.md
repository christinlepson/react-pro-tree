# Website Redesign in React

This project is a redesign of an existing website to a React S.P.A. I took an unresponsive, static website and created a single page application that scales to all screen sizesâ€”complete with component animations, form validation, and emailing logic.

The back-end logic was written in Node.js and Express.
